        Embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. has announced his retirement from the agency, capping off a tenure full of huge projects and fierce criticism. </p>
      
  <p> Carter made the announcement Monday, saying that his retirement becomes official at the end of this month. It comes just days after funding was finally locked in for a substantial extension of the CTA Red Line on the South Side, and comes months after his resignation was demanded by a majority of the members of Chicago’s City Council. </p>
  
      <p> Carter called his tenure “an extraordinary privilege” in a statement published by the city. </p>
  
  <p> “Serving as president of this great agency has been an extraordinary privilege and I am forever grateful for what has been the opportunity of a lifetime,” said Carter. “It has been an honor to work on behalf of CTA customers and to advance our mission in a city that I love so dearly.” </p>

        Carter faced harsd criticism for his handling of the agency over the years, with riders and public officials alike blasting him on a variety of fronts. Concerns about service reliability and rider safety were atop the list, with activist groups and some City Council members also criticizing him for rarely using CTA trains and buses for transportation.
